// Research what a UX Designer does
// User experience (UX) is defined as how one feels when interacting with a product, system, or service. A UX Designer's role involves mapping out the visual, experiential, and functional aspects of a product to optimize the overall user experience (UX). Unlike User Interface (UI) design, which primarily focuses on the product's visual aesthetics, UX design considers the look, feel, and usability, aiming to create products that are useful, usable, enjoyable, and equitable.

// The goals of UX Design encompass:

// 1. **Useful:** Ensuring the product helps users accomplish tasks effortlessly, whether it's sending a quick hello to a friend or planning a weekly schedule.

// 2. **Usable:** Ensuring the product is easily understood and can be used by individuals with average or below-average ability and experience. No matter how beautifully designed a product is, if users can't easily navigate and understand it, they are likely to abandon it.

// 3. **Enjoyable:** Focusing on bringing joy and excitement to the user. Beyond task accomplishment, a successful product should also be a source of delight for users.

// 4. **Equitable:** Making the product useful to people with diverse backgrounds by ensuring accessibility and inclusivity. UX designers conscientiously and intentionally consider the needs of people with disabilities and those experiencing exclusion in various aspects of their lives.

// In executing these goals, UX designers employ tools such as Figma to create High Fidelity Designs. These designs serve as detailed blueprints that encapsulate the visual and interactive elements of the product. Subsequently, these designs are passed on to Front End Developers who use them as a guide to develop products that align with the specifications outlined by the UX designers. This collaborative process ensures that the final product not only meets aesthetic standards but also delivers an exceptional and inclusive user experience.

// Key responsibilities of a UX designer include:

// 1. **User Research:** Conducting research to understand the needs, behaviors, and preferences of the target audience. This involves techniques such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing.

// 2. **Information Architecture:** Organizing and structuring content or information in a way that is logical and user-friendly. This involves creating sitemaps, wireframes, and prototypes to plan the layout and flow of the product.

// 3. **Interaction Design:** Defining how users interact with a product or service. This includes designing the overall user interface, navigation, and interactive elements to ensure a smooth and intuitive user journey.

// 4. **Prototyping:** Building interactive prototypes or mockups to test and validate design concepts. Prototypes help in identifying potential issues and gathering feedback before the final product is developed.

// 5. **Usability Testing:** Evaluating the usability of a product by observing how users interact with prototypes or finished designs. This helps in identifying areas for improvement and refining the user experience.

// 6. **Visual Design:** Working on the aesthetics of the product, including color schemes, typography, and other visual elements. Visual design enhances the overall look and feel of the product while aligning with the brand identity.

// 7. **Accessibility:** Ensuring that the product is accessible to users with different abilities and disabilities. This includes designing for screen readers, ensuring proper contrast, and implementing other accessibility features.

// 8. **Collaboration:** Working closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers, developers, and other stakeholders, to ensure that the design aligns with the overall goals of the project.

// 9. **Iterative Design:** Embracing an iterative design process, where designs are continuously refined based on feedback, user testing, and evolving project requirements.

// Overall, the role of a UX designer is to advocate for the user, understanding their needs and ensuring that the product or service meets those needs in the most effective and enjoyable way possible.


// DevOps usually involved the following:

// The responsibilities of a DevOps engineer can vary depending on the organization and its specific needs. However, here is a list of common responsibilities associated with the role:

// 1. **Collaboration:** Foster collaboration between development, operations, and other relevant teams to enhance communication and streamline processes.

// 2. **Automation:** Implement and manage automated processes for building, testing, and deploying software. This includes creating and maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

// 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use IaC tools like Terraform or Ansible to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

// 4. **Configuration Management:** Implement and manage tools for automating the configuration of systems and applications to maintain consistency across environments.

// 5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring solutions to track the performance and health of applications and infrastructure. Establish logging mechanisms for effective debugging and troubleshooting.

// 6. **Release Management:** Coordinate and manage software releases, ensuring a smooth and reliable deployment process while minimizing downtime.

// 7. **Security:** Collaborate with security teams to integrate security practices into the DevOps pipeline. This includes conducting code scans, vulnerability assessments, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

// 8. **Continuous Improvement:** Evaluate existing processes and workflows regularly to identify areas for improvement. Implement changes to optimize efficiency, reduce bottlenecks, and enhance overall performance.

// 9. **Version Control:** Manage version control systems (e.g., Git) to track and control changes to codebase effectively.

// 10. **Collaboration Tools:** Utilize collaboration tools such as Slack, Jira, and Confluence to facilitate communication, documentation, and project management.

// 11. **Cross-Functional Skills:** Develop a broad skill set that spans development, operations, and infrastructure to effectively collaborate with diverse teams.

// 12. **Problem Solving:** Diagnose and resolve issues related to the development and deployment of software, collaborating with different teams as needed.

// 13. **Scalability and Performance:** Work on optimizing the performance and scalability of applications and infrastructure to handle varying workloads.

// 14. **Cloud Services:** Depending on the organization's infrastructure, work with various cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to deploy and manage applications.

// In addition to the above responsibilities, a DevOps engineer is also involved in:

// - **Automating the deployment of a project (Continuous Deployment):** Streamline and automate the deployment process to ensure quick and reliable software releases.

// - **Automating the test of a project (Continuous Integration):** Implement automated testing processes to catch and address issues early in the development lifecycle.

// - **Containerizing Applications for easy replication (Docker):** Package applications and dependencies into containers for consistent and portable deployment.

// - **Automating the replication and removing of active containers (Kubernetes):** Orchestrate containerized applications for efficient scaling, management, and high availability.

// - **Automating the provisioning of cloud infrastructure (Terraform):** Use infrastructure as code to automate the provisioning and configuration of cloud resources.

// Essentially, a DevOps engineer plays a crucial role in taking the application created by software engineers, ensuring it is bug-free, and optimizing it for efficient and reliable performance for end-users. In the software development lifecycle, UX designers create the design, software engineers build the application, and DevOps engineers deploy and scale the application through automation and collaboration.

function validCard(number) {
    // Convert the number to a string for easier manipulation
    let numStr = number.toString();

    // Initialize variables for checksum and total
    let checksum = parseInt(numStr.charAt(numStr.length - 1));
    let total = 0;

    // Iterate through the digits of the card number
    for (let i = numStr.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        let sum = 0;
        let digit = parseInt(numStr.charAt(i));

        if ((numStr.length - i) % 2 === 0) {
            digit *= 2;
            sum = Math.floor(digit / 10) + (digit % 10);
        } else {
            sum = digit;
        }

        total += sum;
    }

    // Check if the card number is valid based on the Luhn algorithm
    return (10 - (total % 10)) === checksum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(validCard(1234567890123456)); // Output: false
console.log(validCard(4408041234567893)); // Output: true
console.log(validCard(38520000023237)); // Output: true
console.log(validCard(4222222222222)); // Output: true
