// A. The basics
// Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive
for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
console.log(i)
// Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400
for(let j = 10; j <= 400; j+= 10)
console.log([j])
// Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000
for(let k = 12; k <= 4000; k += 3){
    console.log([k])
}
// B. Get even students should use modulus
// Print out the numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100
// Adjust your code to add a message next to even numbers only that says: "<-- is an even number"

for(let l = 0; l<= 100; l++){
    console.log(l)
}

// C. Give me Five students should use modulus
// For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a number. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five
